# Benchdrill

Benchdrill is a benchmarking tool based on [Machinery (revision fdcbe0f of 2017-5-31)](https://github.com/RichardKnop/machinery/tree/fdcbe0ff6b8592b8ebc65f76fd63af3f6f90c3a7), an asynchronous task queue/job queue based on distributed message passing. It allows to load charges thanks to Machineryâ€™s workers, which are distributed with in a Docker Swarm. It is possible to send jobs in parallel to the workers through the queue. Workers which will execute them and return the result as soon as they are ready. They can run tools as [Filebench](https://github.com/filebench/filebench).

Workers can be scaled up or down thanks to Docker, by scaling up or down the `benchdrill-worker` service with the `docker service scale` command.

## Installation
First you need Go 1.8 and Docker v17.06. Then, after cloning this repository with Git, run the following commands in a terminal in the root directory of Benchdrill:

``` shell
$ docker pull wolphinproject/benchdrill
$ ./stack/benchdrill-network
$ ./stack/benchdrill-deploy
```

## Usage
Benchdrill commands are run with `stack/benchdrill-cli`. Currently there are 2 commands with Benchdrill: `send_cmd_args` and `send_cmd_file`. The first one send a command to a worker, possibly with arguments, the second one allows to send the content of a local file given as an argument to a worker, which will save the content on a file then use it.

Two benchmark tools are currently supported: [Sysbench](https://github.com/akopytov/sysbench) and [Filebench](https://github.com/filebench/filebench). Below two commands you can run, given as examples.

``` shell
$ ./stack/benchdrill-cli send_cmd_args "sysbench --time=5 cpu run"
```

This command will send the command quoted to a single worker, which will run a built-in CPU test of Sysbench for 5 seconds.

``` shell
$ ./stack/benchdrill-cli --times 3 send_cmd_file "filebench -f" < readfiles.f
```

This command will send the command quoted 3 times as 3 separate and identical tasks executed simultaneously (thanks to the ``--times`` option); it will run the test written in `readfiles.f` (provided in the repository as an example).

## Architecture

![Architecture schema of Benchdrill](architecture_schema.png)

Both Redis and Worker services are in a Docker Swarm. A Swarm is a cluster in which each node has a Docker engine. A node can be a manager or a worker. In Swarm mode concepts are not about containers but about services. A service is the task a manager or a worker has to execute. It can be several identical containers distributed across nodes. In our case, the Redis service is composed of a unique container, but the Worker service has several identical containers and can be scaled up or down with a `docker service scale` command.
